# TalkJS Flutter SDK example

An example project that shows both the ChatBox and ConversationList widgets of TalkJS

## Getting Started

The first thing to do is to install all the dependencies with the command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

This is to be done only once.

After that, change in the `lib/main.dart` file the 'YOUR_APP_ID' string with a
valid appId.

Finally, connect an Android/iOS device or emulator and run:

```bash
flutter run
```

to run the example.

## How it works

This example uses the 'provider' package to manage a global app state.

The `MyAppState` class has a `session` and a `conversation` properties, that
are used by the ChatBox and ConversationList widgets.

The `conversation` property is in reality a getter and setter pair, in order
to call the `notifyListeners()` functions whenever the `conversation` property
is changed.

In our `main()` function the TalkJS Session is initialized, and is used as the
global app state.

The app has 3 routes:
'/' contains the buttons to select either a ChatBox or ConversationList
'/chatbox' is the ChatBox screen, and finally
'/conversationlist' is the ConversationList screen.

The ChatBoxScreen uses Consumer<MyAppState> in order to get the global session
and conversation objects, and be able to rebuild itself whenever the global
state changes.

The ConversationList has an event called `onSelectConversation` that is
triggered when the user clicks on a conversation.
When the event is triggered, a new `Conversation` object is built, using the
`id` ov the selected conversation, then this object is assigned to the global
app state, and finally we navigate to the '/chatbox' route to show a ChatBox
widget with the selected conversation.
