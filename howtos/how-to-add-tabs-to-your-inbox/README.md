# How to add tabs to your inbox

This is an example project to go with the [How to add tabs to your inbox](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-add-tabs-to-your-inbox/) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you will need:

- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/)

## How to run the tutorial

1. Clone or download this project.
2. Go to `index.js`, and replace `<APP_ID>` with your own app ID. You can find your app ID on the **Settings** page of the [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/).

Conversations only show up in the conversation list in the inbox [if the conversation contains at least one message](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Chat_UI_Modes/The_Inbox/#conversations-in-the-inbox). To try out the inbox tab filtering, create at least one 1-on-1 conversation (direct message), and one group chat.
