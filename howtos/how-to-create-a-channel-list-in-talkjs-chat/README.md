## Project setup

- All HTML, CSS and JavaScript code is contained within the `index.html` file for the sake of simplicity.
- Replace the `APP_ID` in each `index.html` with your own app ID. You can find your app ID on the **Settings** page of your [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/).
- Run the demo by opening the `index.html` file in your  browser, it's that simple!
