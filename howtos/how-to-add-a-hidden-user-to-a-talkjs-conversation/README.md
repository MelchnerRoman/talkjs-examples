This is an example project to go with our tutorial on [how to add a hidden user to your TalkJS chat](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-add-a-hidden-user-to-a-talkjs-conversation/).

This project adds a new [TalkJS theme](https://talkjs.com/docs/Features/Themes/) and edits different components within it to hide a user that has a custom property.
