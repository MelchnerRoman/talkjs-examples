## Project setup

+ Replace the `APP_ID` in `script.js` with your own app ID. You can find your app ID on the **Settings** page of your [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/). 
+ Create conversations with custom attributes "archived" and "supportTopic".
+ Create an inbox feed filter to display on conversations that satisfy the custom property you set earlier.
