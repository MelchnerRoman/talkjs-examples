# Team chat with threads example

This example extends our [team chat with channels example](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/tree/master/react/remote-work-demo) to add reply threads (like Slack or Teams). It's similar to our [remote work demo](https://talkjs.com/demo/team-chat/) that you can try on our website.

See our [How to add reply threads to your TalkJS team chat](https://talkjs.com/resources/how-to-add-threads-to-your-team-chat-with-talkjs/) tutorial for more details.

The example uses React version 18. You can use the React SDK with versions 17 and up.

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you will need:

- A [TalkJS account](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## Instructions

1. Clone or [download this project](https://github.com/talkjs/talkjs-examples/releases/latest/download/react.team-chat-with-threads.zip).
1. Start ngrok with `ngrok http 3001`. You should see a forwarding URL which is something like `https://<YOUR_URL>.ngrok-free.app`
1. In the TalkJS dashboard:
   1. In the **Themes** tab, select to **Edit** the `team_chat` theme and replace the `UserMessage` template with the version in `theme/UserMessage.txt`.
   1. In the **Chat UI** tab:
      1. Select the `default` role and select to use the `team_chat` theme
      1. Under **Built-in message actions**, select "None" for the **Reply** action
      1. Under **Custom message actions**, create a new action with a name of "replyInThread" and a label of "Reply in thread", available to all messages for users with write permission
   1. In the **Settings** tab under **Webhooks**:
      1. enable the "message.sent" option.
      1. Add the ngrok URL to **Webhook URLs** in the TalkJS dashboard, adding `/update-reply-count`: `https://<YOUR_URL>.ngrok-free.app/update-reply-count`
1. Inside the `/backend` directory:
   1. Replace `<APP_ID>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` in `server.js` with the values found in the **Settings** tab of your [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login).
   1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
   1. Start the server with `npm start`
1. Inside the `/src` directory:
   1. Replace `<APP_ID>` in `talkjsConfig.js` with the value found in the **Settings** tab of your [TalkJS dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/login)
   1. Install dependencies by either running `npm install`
   1. Start the app with `npm start`

You can now view your app at localhost:3000.

The app is prepopulated with a default user and a couple of hardcoded conversations, which easily can be replaced with your own users and conversations. You can find these conversations and the default `userId` in `src/talkJsConfig.js` as well.
