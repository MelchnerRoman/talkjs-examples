# Buyer-seller chat in React with TalkJS

This directory contains two buyer-seller marketplace applications: one with and one without chat functionality.

The application without chat functionality serves as a start application for the TalkJS implementation tutorial [Add buyer-seller chat into a marketplace with React]](https://talkjs.com/tutorials/article/add-buyer-seller-chat-into-a-marketplace-with-react/), in which chat functionalities are being added within a project. The final product of the tutorial is the marketplace application with chat functionality. 

The applications both realize a simplified use case of a marketplace. In this marketplace, users are able to log in, view product listings and chat with the vendor of a product in several different ways (obviously, the chat functionalities are only implemented in the application with chat functionalities).

Both applications have been built in React, with Redux and by using the Container Pattern and TypeScript.
